# Changelog

This is a fork of https://github.com/richinseattle/newdraw

All notable changes to the original project will be documented in this file.


## 2019-10-03
### Added
- default filename in save-dialog if newdraw was started with a filename argument:
	now, you just need to press <keyb>Enter</keyb> to overwrite
	which is comfortable for interim savings

### Changed
- program saves to original file and creates a `backupfile.ansi~`; 
  saving a copy to the `art`-directory instead of saving to the original file was removed

### Removed
- the `art`-directory is obsolete now
