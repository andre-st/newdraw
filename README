	New Draw - an ANSI editor for ncurses capable systems

WHAT IS IT?

  New Draw is an ANSI editor similar to TheDRAW, ACiDDraw, and Duh DRAW.
  It runs on GNU/Linux and other POSIX-like operating systems that support the
  ncurses library for terminal I/O.

ANSI GRAPHICS AND THE IBM CP437 CHARACTER SET

  ANSI and ASCII graphics use the IBM CP437 character set.  This is usually
  not set by default in terminal programs such as PuTTY, KDE Konsole, or the
  regular Linux terminal.
  
  New Draw currently does not attempt to change the character by default but
  instead expects the user to configure it.  You can use the ``-f'' command
  line option to force the IBM CP437 character set.  Please note that it only
  works for regular text-mode terminals at the moment.

CONFIGURING CHARACTER SET FOR YOUR TERMINAL

  PuTTY:
    
      In the "Window\Translation" settings, choose character set "CP437." Set
      function keys behavior to "Xterm R6" in "Terminal\Keyboard" settings to
      get access to all function keys.

  xterm:

      If you have dosemu installed, you can start a new xterm with the correct
      character set like this:

      xset +fp /usr/share/dosemu/Xfonts/
      xterm -fn vga

  If you get New Draw working correctly on other terminals, please send the
  instructions to <penberg@iki.fi> and they will be included here.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

  The program accepts the following command line options:

	-h  Help
	-f  Force IBM CP437 character set.

	-c <cols>  Set the number of columns for the edit buffer.
	-r <rows>  Set the number of rows for the edit buffer.

  Here are the keyboard commands:

	Cursors / Pg Up / Pg Dn / End / Home  Move cursor around
	META - x  Quit
	META - s  Save to file
	META - Up / Down  Change background color

  Please note that the META key is usually the ESC or Alt key depending on
  your configuration.
